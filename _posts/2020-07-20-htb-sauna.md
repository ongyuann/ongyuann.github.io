Most important things to spot are:
1- There's an IIS server (port 80)
2- There's a Kerberos server (port 88)
3- There's the usual SMB ports (ports 135 and 445)
  
  
With these, we can start working. 

### Port 80
Browse the web server and we see a website by bank called Egotistical Bank. Observe that this is an information-only site, and that it's a custom-made application, so there's no special access to gain on the web application and no public exploits we can find for some quick wins. However, since we know there's Kerberos and some SMB ports open, we can start by finding possible usernames that we can use to crack some openings into either Kerberos or SMB.
  
  
And as luck would have it, we find the names of the employees on the "About Us" page.

Fergus Smith
Shaun Coins
Hugo Bear
Bowie Taylor
Sophie Driver
Steven Kerb
```

We'll keep these for now, see that there's nothing much else we can do on the site, and proceed to the next port.

### Port 88
TBD
