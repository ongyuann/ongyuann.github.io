```
Write about the following topic:
A personâ€™s worth nowadays seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions. Old-fashioned values, such as honour, kindness and trust, no longer seem important.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
```
To the extent that this discussion is centred around what seems, instead of what is, I agree that in our day and age, a person's worth seems to be judged more heavily based on social status and material possessions, and more likely on old-fashioned values.
