Write about the following topic:
A personâ€™s worth nowadays seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions. Old-fashioned values, such as honour, kindness and trust, no longer seem important.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.

To the extent that this discussion is centred around what seems, instead of what is, I agree that with this opinion. I believe there are two main causes behind this shifting perception of a person's worth. First, that we now live in an age that almost seems to constantly demand instant judgement. Second, that we now live in an age that is relatively much more prosperous than all previous generations. However, despite what it seems, I believe that old-fashioned values are still important in this day and age, and I believe we still rely on those values especially in situations of greater consequence.
  
  
Ever since the proliferation of electronic media, numerous debates have been had over its possible negative effects on society. Some of these debates argue over the effect of instantly gratifying the curiosity of the human mind - of the possible dangers of creating a "shallower" pattern of thought as media forms become shorter, faster, and more digestible as numerous sources of news grasp for the reader's attention. If we accept that basic economic principles of supply and demand are universally true, then a short look around confirms the hypotheses posited by those debates. Indeed, over just the last decade, we have surely witnessed media forms shrink and shorten into ever smaller chunks, ideal for quick consumption of the mind. Put in the explosion of social media usage over the last few years, and we have a society gripped in a pandemic of ever shorter attention spans. 
  
  
Over the last few decades, the world has also seen ever greater portions of humanity lifted beyond the depths of poverty. Economic growth has prospered all over the world in the absence of major conflicts for more than half a century. In this prosperous new age, material possessions and social status seem much more attainable than the generations of the previous centuries. As more and more people become prosperous, signs of wealth become more numerous and complex, and as society as a whole value greater prosperity, the visual signs of wealth become more noticeable.
  
  
Now put yourselves in the shoes of someone who has to judge a person's worth quicky, and consider the above factors; this someone has been conditioned to judge quickly by societal patterns of behaviour, in a social climate that prizes and notices prosperity. I believe that it is far more likely that this someone will judge another person's worth based on social status and material possessions, more so given that such symbols are usually visual, where are greatly accessible through modern media.
  
  
That being said, I believe that if this someone was judging another person for a position or situation of great consequence, the old-fashioned values of honour, kindness, and trust, would instantly come back into play. For example - choosing a marriage partner, or recruiting a potential colleague. I believe that in those situations, the judgement process would be lengthened - think dates, or rounds of interviews. In fact it would even be possible that in such situations, seemingly obvious cues of social status and material possessions would be viewed with caution. 
  
  
Therefore, I only agree with the opinion to the extent that the discussion is around what seems, instead of what is.
