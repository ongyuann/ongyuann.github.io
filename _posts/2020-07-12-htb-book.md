Another week flew by and I didn't find much to write, other than HTB write-ups. This time Book has retired, and that gives me an opportunity to write. So here goes :)

### Recce
Doing the usual nmap scan reveals a few services, but none more interesting than the good-ol' port 80.
```
kali@kali:~/htb/boxes/book/nmap$ cat initial.txt 
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Fri Apr 10 19:00:29 2020 as: nmap -v -sC -sV -oN initial.txt -Pn book.htb
Increasing send delay for 10.10.10.176 from 0 to 5 due to 136 out of 453 dropped probes since last increase.

```

### Port 80
Visit port 80 and you find yourself confronted by the login page. Sign up with anything you choose, and see that it works.

Look around, scan it with nikto, do your directory-busting thing and you probably still wouldn't find a way forward. The box is written on a custom PHP application and does not seem to have any opportunities for SQL injection or other sort of injection vulnerabilities, at least while logged in as a normal user. 
  
  
You might however have noticed in your directory-busting thing that there's an `/admin` directory on the box:

Visit the `admin` directory, and be confronted with a login page that looks exactly like the login / signup page that you first encountered. Try some SQL injection, and see that it utterly doesn't work. Simply trying to trigger an SQL error doesn't give you anything to bite at - the app just quickly returns a 'Nope!' message. However, if you had taken a proper look around while in your user account earlier, you would've noticed on the `Contact Us` page that there's an email address linked to the admin: `admin@book.htb`, which would've given us a username to work with if say we wanted to brute-force the `/admin` login page.
